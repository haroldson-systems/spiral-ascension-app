MODULE 1 — MENTAL ALCHEMY (THE PATH FROM THOUGHT TO SPELL)
					
TIER 2 — THE APPRENTICE
Hermetic Law: All is Mind Chakra: Third Eye (Ajna) Frequency Anchor: 852 Hz — Return to Spiritual Order Element: Ether Access Point: Vision + Imagination
						
Opening Breath work: The Vision Gate
						
Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Focus between your brows.                                                        → Inhale (5): “I see.” → Hold (3): “I receive.” → Exhale (7): “I release distortion.”
↺ Repeat for 6–8 cycles. Let imagery arise.
					
Core Understanding:
Your vision is a blueprint. It’s not fantasy — it’s instruction. You apprentice by learning to recognize false visions from true. Fear imagines disaster. Faith imagines alignment. What you imagine — you inform.
						
Ritual: Vision Scripting
						
Materials: Journal, 852 Hz audio. Imagine a version of you 1 year ahead. Describe that life in 5 sensory-rich paragraphs. Underline every phrase that feels anchored in truth. Read it aloud: “This is not pretend. This is pre-form.” Seal: “I am the author of the unseen.”

Breath Rites: Inner Sight Sequence → Inhale (5): Light floods in through third eye → Hold (3): Image forms → Exhale (7): Send it outward → Pause (2): Stay in vision ↺ Repeat 7 rounds. Use before creative or decision-making tasks.
					
Closing Words:
The eye sees, but the mind selects. You are the selector. Choose visions that            serve you — and you begin to serve the spiral.
